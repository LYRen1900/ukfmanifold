    A point X on the manifold is represented as a symmetric positive definite
     matrix X (nxn). Tangent vectors are symmetric matrices of the same size
     (but not necessarily definite).

     The Riemannian metric is the bi-invariant metric, described notably in
     Chapter 6 of the 2007 book "Positive definite matrices"
     by Rajendra Bhatia, Princeton University Press.
